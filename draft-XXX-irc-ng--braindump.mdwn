Scope
=====

Explore viability of using partially/fully meshed inter-server links for IRC networks.

Existing work
=============

* http://wiki.inspircd.org/IRC_Meshing
* http://www.db.net/~db/LazyLinks.txt
* http://etherpad.tools.ietf.org:9000/p/irc

Problems
========

* Maintaining consistent state
* All messages by one source need to arrive in the same order on all servers and clients
* Overall state must sync eventually

Approach
========

* Servers are partially meshed, ideally with Shortest-Path-First
* All sources are assigned a UUID and a counter. That way, message order can be enforced
* Batch ACKing of all UUIDs and counters may be needed
	* Servers which are out of sync too often may need to receive a kill signal and then delink
